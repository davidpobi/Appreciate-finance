# Personal Wealth Dashboard for Alpaca Trading API

This application interfaces with the Alpaca Trading API and was created to enhance my investing experience. I found existing tools too complex and lacking essential features, so I decided to build something more user-friendly and minimalist. The aim is to provide an easy-to-use interface for buying and managing my favorite assets. Itâ€™s an ongoing project, and I will keep updating it as I gain more insights on my investing journey

## Stack
- Next.js (Fullstack framework)
